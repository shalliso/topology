1. (Intermediate Value Theorem) Let $$X$$ be a connected topological space and give $$\mathbb{R}$$ the standard topology. Let $$f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ be a continuous function. Let $$a, b \in X$$ and suppose $$r \in \mathbb{R}$$ satisfies $$a < r < b$$. Show that there is some $$c \in X$$ with $$f(c) = r$$.

What if we didn't want to assume $$X$$ is connected? Is there a weaker assumption involving $$a, b$$ we covered in class that would suffice?

2. Show that if $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are two path-connected topological spaces then the product $$X \times Y$$ is path-connected.

3. Let $$X$$ be a topological space. Define an equivalence relation $$\sim$$ on $$X$$ as follows: for any two points $$x, y \in X$$, write $$x \sim y$$ iff there is a connected set containing both $$x$$ and $$y$$. Prove that the equivalence classes $$[x]_\sim$$ are preciecely the connected components of $$X$$.

4. The following is proved in the textbook but I recommend you try to prove it yourself. A subset $$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$ is called an **interval** if for every $$r < s \in A$$ we have $$(r, s) \subseteq A$$. Show that the intervals of $$\mathbb{R}$$ are precisely the sets of the form $$(a, b)$$, $$[a, b)$$, $$(a, b]$$, and $$[a, b]$$. 

Now give $$\mathbb{R}$$ the standard topology. Show that a set $$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$ is an interval iff it is connected iff it is path-connected.

5. Recall the Baire space $$\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$$ from the second writtn assignment. Is it connected? If not, what are the connected components? What about for path-connectedness?

6. Consider the function $$f : (-\infty, 0) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ defined by $$f(t) = sin(1/t)$$. Draw the graph of this function. Let $$C = \{(0, y) \mid y \in [-1, 1]\}$$. Show that $$graph(y) \cup C$$ is connected but not path-connected. Prove this carefully!
