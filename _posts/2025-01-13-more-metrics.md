Let $$X$$ be a set and let $$\tau_1$$ and $$\tau_2$$ be two topologies on $$X$$ with bases $$\mathcal{B}_1$$ and $$\mathcal{B}_2$$ respectively.
We checked that if for any $$\tau_1$$-set $$U \subseteq X$$ and $$x \in U$$, if there is some $$V \in \mathcal{B}_2$$ such that $$x \in V \subseteq U$$ then $$\tau_2$$ is finer than $$\tau_1$$.

Let $$(X, d)$$ be a metric space. Let 

$$\hat{d} : X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\ge 0}$$

be defined by

$$\hat{d}(x, y) = \min(d(x, y), 1).$$

We verified in lecture that this is indeed a metric, but we didn't check all the details that it generates the same topology on $$X$$ as $$d$$.


First, we confirm that the topology generated by $$\hat{d}$$ is finer than the topology generated by $$d$$.
Fix arbitrary $$y \in X$$ and $$\epsilon > 0$$ and fix arbitrary $$x \in B_d(y, \epsilon)$$.
Choose $$\delta = \min(\epsilon - d(x, y), 1)$$.
We claim that $$B_{\hat{d}}(x, \delta) \subseteq B_d(y, \epsilon)$$.
Indeed, fix some arbitrary $$z \in B_{\hat{d}}(x, \delta)$$.
We have $$\hat{d}(x, z) < \delta$$ and so $$\hat{d}(x, z) < 1$$ which means $$\hat{d}(x, z) = d(x, z)$$, thus in particular we have $$d(x, z) < \delta$$.
Therefore we have $$d(z, y) \le d(z, x) + d(x, y) < \delta + d(x, y) \le \epsilon - d(x, y) + d(x, y) = \epsilon$$.
This means $$z \in B_d(y, \epsilon)$$ as desired.

On the other hand, fix arbitrary $$y \in X$$ and $$\epsilon > 0$$ and fix arbitrary $$x \in B_{\hat{d}}(y, \epsilon)$$.
Choose $$\delta = \epsilon - d(x, y)$$.
We claim that $$B_{d}(x, \delta) \subseteq B_{\hat{d}}(y, \epsilon)$$.
As before, fix some arbitrary $$z \in B_{d}(x, \delta)$$ which means $$d(x, z) < \delta$$.
We have $$\hat{d}(z, y) \le \hat{d}(z, x) + \hat{d}(x, y) \le d(z, x) + d(x, y) < \delta + d(x, y) = \epsilon - d(x, y) + d(x, y) = \epsilon$$.
This means $$z \in B_{\hat{d}}(y, \epsilon)$$ as desired.


You'll prove a result on the second written assignment that gives a nicer way of proving that two metrics generate the same topology.

We also defined three metrics on $$\mathbb{R}$$:
1. The standard Euclidean metric: $$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$$
2. The Manhattan metric: $$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \|x_1 - y_1\| + \|x_2 - y_2\|$$
3. The square distance: $$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \max(\|x_1 - y_1\|, \|x_2 - y_2\|)$$

You will check on the second written assignment that these are all indeed metrics and generate the same topology on $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.
