Given a topological space $$(X, \tau)$$ and a subset $$Y \subseteq X$$, we can define the **subspace topology** $$\tau_Y$$ on $$Y$$ to be the topology on $$Y$$ consisting of the open sets $$U \cap Y$$ where $$U$$ is an arbitrary $$\tau$$-open subset of $$X$$.

We checked that this is indeed a topology and also checked that if we have a topological basis on $$X$$ then in a similar way we can get a natural tolological basis on $$Y$$.

Given the topological space $$\mathbb{R}$$ with the standard topology and $$Y = [0, 1]$$ we asked if there is a "nice" basis for the subspace topology on $$Y$$. We got the sets
$$\{(a, b) \mid 0 \le a < b \le 1\} \cup \{[0, b) \mid 0 < b \le 1\} \cup \{(a, 1] \mid 0 \le a < 1\} \cup \{\emptyset\}.$$

Given the topological space $$\mathbb{R}$$ with the standard topology and $$Y = [0, 1) \cup \{2\}$$ we asked if there is a "nice" basis for the subspace topology on $$Y$$. We got the sets
$$\{(a, b) \mid 0 \le a < b \le 1\} \cup \{[0, b) \mid 0 < b \le 1\} \cup \{2\} \cup \{\emptyset\}.$$

Given topological spaces $$(X, \tau_X)$$ and $$(Y, \tau_Y)$$ we defined the **product topology** on $$X \times Y$$ to be the topology $$\tau_{X \times Y}$$ on $$X \times Y$$ generated by the basis of sets of the form $$U \times V$$ where $$U$$ and $$V$$ are arbitrary $$\tau_X$$-open and $$\tau_Y$$-open sets respectively.

We checked that these sets do indeed form a topological basis and thus generate a topology.

We sketched an informal proof (with pictures) that $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ along with the topology generated by the standard Euclidean metric 
$$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$$
is the same topology as the product topology of $$\mathbb{R}$$ with the standard topology with itself.
This shows that there are two very different descriptions of the same topology on $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.

Finally, we introduced the notion of functions between topological spaces that respect the underlying structure. 
Given topological spaces $$(X, \tau_X)$$ and $$(Y, \tau_Y)$$, a function $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ is **continuous** if for any $$\tau_Y$$-open $$U \subseteq Y$$ the preimage $$f^{-1}(U)$$ is $$\tau_X$$-open.

We checked that the following functions are indeed continuous:
1. The function $$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ defined by $$f(x) = 2x + 1$$ is continuous with the respect the the standard topology on $$\mathbb{R}$$ on both the domain and codomain
2. The function $$\pi_1 : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ defined by $$\pi_1(x, y) = x$$ is continuous with respect to the standard topology on $$\mathbb{R}$$ and the standard topology on $$\mathbb{R}$$
3. The function $$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ defined by $$f(x) = 2$$ is continuous with the standard topology on $$\mathbb{R}$$ on both the domain and the codomain.
