title: "Some multiple choice questions to play around with"
categories: note
---

I've been messing around with AI a bit and tried giving all of the lecture notes so far as well as the two written assignments to GPT o1 and asking it to produce some practice test questions.
Overall, the results have been mixed, but when I asked it to produce simple multiple choice questions it seemed to do a good job.
I just needed to throw away a few bad questions and fix a few others.
Feel free to use these questions to test your understanding of the definitions but keep in mind they're rather shallow, and the questions on the test will require deeper thought (and there will not be any multiple choice questions on the test).

I tried asking it to produce more complicated short and long answer questions but the results were significantly lower in quality and the solutions it produced were wrong more often than not.
If you want some practice questions, the textbook has a lot of good exercises, many of which are worked out in the back of the book.

I read through all the questions and checked its answer key, but my experience with AI is that it is very good at making wrong things look convincing. So if you spot anything that looks off that I may have missed, please let me know!

One note: I am hesitant to involve AI in this course since I don't want students to start to have doubts that maybe the assignments, lecture notes, or grading is done by AI. They are not. Even if I wanted to, we're not quite there yet. If I ever distribute any material produced by AI in this course I will clearly say so.

I have no current plan to produce practice questions like this as a regular thing. I just wanted to get a sense of the current capabilities of AI.

Anyway, have fun! I hope you get some use from these!
